/**
 * @fileOverview
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for patient and doctor profiles,
 * ensuring that only authenticated users can access their own data.
 * Access to appointments and health records is also restricted to the owning patient or doctor.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/patients/{patientId}`: Stores patient profile data, accessible only to the patient.
 * - `/doctors/{doctorId}`: Stores doctor profile data, accessible only to the doctor.
 * - `/patients/{patientId}/appointments/{appointmentId}`: Stores appointments for a specific patient.
 * - `/doctors/{doctorId}/appointments/{appointmentId}`: Stores appointments for a specific doctor.
 * - `/patients/{patientId}/healthRecords/{healthRecordId}`: Stores health records for a specific patient.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own profile data.
 * - Appointments are associated with both patients and doctors, allowing each to manage them.
 * - Health records are private to the patient.
 * - List operations are restricted to the owner of the data.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  None required, ownership is enforced by path-based authentication.
