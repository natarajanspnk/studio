/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for MediConnect Platform
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for Patients and Doctors profile data.
 * Appointments and HealthRecords are organized as subcollections of both patients and doctors to allow for easy querying from either perspective.
 * Only authenticated users can access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /patients/{patientId} : Patient profile information, accessible only by the patient.
 * - /doctors/{doctorId} : Doctor profile information, accessible only by the doctor.
 * - /patients/{patientId}/appointments/{appointmentId} : Appointments for a specific patient.
 * - /doctors/{doctorId}/appointments/{appointmentId} : Appointments for a specific doctor.
 * - /patients/{patientId}/healthRecords/{healthRecordId} : Health records for a specific patient.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own profile data (patients and doctors).
 * - Appointments are stored as subcollections of both patients and doctors, allowing easy querying from either perspective, but enforcing individual ownership.
 * - Health records are stored as subcollections of patients, ensuring patient-only access (with potential for authorized doctor access via a membership map - not yet implemented).
 * - Data validation is limited to relational integrity and authorization-critical fields for rapid prototyping.
 * - List operations are restricted to the owner of the data.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The design assumes that the `patientId` and `doctorId` are present in the subcollection documents (appointments and health records) to allow for direct ownership checks without additional `get()` calls.
